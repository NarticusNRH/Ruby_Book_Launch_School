#Using next, modify the code below so that it only prints even numbers.

number = 0

until number == 10
  number += 1
  next if number.odd?
  puts number
end

=begin solution
Sometimes when using a loop, you need to skip to the next iteration. 
That's where next comes in. next lets you skip to the next iteration based on certain conditions. 
In this exercise, we use next to skip to the next iteration when number is odd. We can use the method Integer#odd? to evaluate number and return true if it's an odd number.
